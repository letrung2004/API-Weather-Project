# This is a weather forecast website for provinces in Vietnam 
- The languages ​​used are **HTML, CSS, Javascript** 
- I got the actual data from the OpenWeather website (https://openweathermap.org/api)
- The data after being called by Postman will be saved to a .JSON file and then I will use Javascript to get the data just read to the screen.
# This is the image after Postman requests real data from the Weather API
